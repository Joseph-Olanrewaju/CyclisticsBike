```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installing Packages and Library
```{r `Loading Libraries`}
library(tidyverse)
library(fs)
library(skimr)
library(conflicted)
```
```{r}
# Setting dplyr::filter and dplyr::lag as the default choices
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
conflict_prefer("lag", "dplyr")

```
#=========================
# STEP 1: COLLECTTING DATA
#=========================
## Uploading Divvy datasets (csv files) for data analytics processes 

```{r Reading files into memory}
cyclistics_q1_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv")
cyclistics_q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```
#=============================================================
# STEP 2: WRANGLING DATA AND COMBINING THEM INTO A SINGLE FILE
#=============================================================
## Comparing column names in each of the files
```{r Loading Colnames}
colnames(cyclistics_q1_2019)
colnames(cyclistics_q1_2020)

```

## Renaming columns  to make them consistent with cyclistics_q1_2020 (as this will be the supposed going-forward table design for Divvy datasets)

```{r Renaming for consistency}
(cyclistics_q1_2019 <- rename(cyclistics_q1_2019
                              ,ride_id = trip_id
                              ,rideable_type = bikeid
                              ,started_at = start_time
                              ,ended_at = end_time
                              ,start_station_name = from_station_name
                              ,start_station_id = from_station_id
                              ,end_station_name = to_station_name
                              ,end_station_id = to_station_id
                              ,member_casual = usertype
))

```
## Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies
```{r Loading sructure of datasets}
str(cyclistics_q1_2019)
str(cyclistics_q1_2020)

```
# Converting ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly
```{r Converting ride_id}
cyclistics_q1_2019 <-  mutate(cyclistics_q1_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                              ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 

```
## Stacking individual quarter's data frames into one big data frame
```{r Stacking the datasets in single df}
cyclistics_all_trips <- bind_rows(cyclistics_q1_2019, cyclistics_q1_2020)

colnames(cyclistics_all_trips)

```
## Removing birthyear, gender, lat, long, fields as this data was dropped beginning in 2020
```{r Removing some features}
cyclistics_all_trips <- cyclistics_all_trips %>%  
  select(-c(birthyear, gender,  "tripduration", start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))

```
```{r}
colnames(cyclistics_all_trips)
```
#============================================================
# STEP 3: CLEANING UP AND ADDING DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
#============================================================
## Inspecting the new table that has been created
```{r }
colnames(cyclistics_all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(cyclistics_all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(cyclistics_all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(cyclistics_all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  
tail(cyclistics_all_trips)  #See the last 6 rows of data frame
str(cyclistics_all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(cyclistics_all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

```
## Observations that falls under each ridertype
```{r}
table(cyclistics_all_trips$member_casual)
```
## Reassigning labels to the desired values (I go with the current 2020 labels)
```{r Changing Labels}
cyclistics_all_trips <-  cyclistics_all_trips %>% 
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual
                                ,"Subscriber" = "member"
                                ,"Customer" = "casual"))

```
## Checking to ensure the proper number of observations were reassigned
```{r }
table(cyclistics_all_trips$member_casual)

```
## Adding columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
### This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level
```{r}
cyclistics_all_trips$date <- as.Date(cyclistics_all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
cyclistics_all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(cyclistics_all_trips$date), "%m")
cyclistics_all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(cyclistics_all_trips$date), "%d")
cyclistics_all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(cyclistics_all_trips$date), "%Y")
cyclistics_all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(cyclistics_all_trips$date), "%A")

```
## Adding "ride_length" calculation to cyclistics_all_trips (in seconds)
```{r}
cyclistics_all_trips$ride_length <- 
  difftime(cyclistics_all_trips$ended_at, cyclistics_all_trips$started_at)
```
##Inspecting the structure of the columns
```{r}
str(cyclistics_all_trips)

```
## Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
```{r}
is.factor(cyclistics_all_trips$ride_length)
cyclistics_all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(cyclistics_all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(cyclistics_all_trips$ride_length)

```
## Removing "bad" data
### The dataframe includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative
### We will create a new version of the dataframe (v2) since data is being removed
```{r}
cyclistics_all_trips_v2 <- cyclistics_all_trips[!(cyclistics_all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | cyclistics_all_trips$ride_length<0),]
```
#========================================
# STEP 4: CONDUCTING DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
#========================================
## Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)
```{r}
mean(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length) #straight average (total ride length / rides)
median(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length) #longest ride
min(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length) #shortest ride

```
## Condensed as below
```{r}
summary(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length)

```
## Compare members and casual users
```{r}
aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)

```
## Viewing the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
```{r}
aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual + cyclistics_all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

```
## Fixing the order of the days of the week.
```{r}
cyclistics_all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual + cyclistics_all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```
## analyzing ridership data by type and weekdays
```{r}
cyclistics_all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)								# sorts


```
#======================================================================
# STEP 5: EXPORTING SUMMARY FILE FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATIONS
#======================================================================
## Creating a csv file that we will visualize in Tableau for my presentations to the stakeholders.
```{r}
counts <- aggregate(cyclistics_all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ cyclistics_all_trips_v2$member_casual + cyclistics_all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
write.csv(counts, file = "C:\\Users\\multi\\Document\\cyclistics_avg_ride_length2.csv")

```
## Visualizing the Average Ride Length by Rider Type

##Key Insights for Marketing Strategy:
1. Casual Riders Have Higher Ride Lengths on Thursdays 

    *Thursday stands out with an average ride length of 133.8 minutes for casual riders.

    *This suggests that casual riders may be using bikes for leisure or long trips, possibly after work or during flexible schedules.

2. Consistent Low Ride Length for Members

    *Members have a stable and much shorter ride length across all days.
    *This suggests they use bikes more for short, consistent commutes rather than leisure.

3. Weekend Potential for Conversion

    *Casual riders still maintain a relatively higher ride length on Fridays (59.9 min) and Saturdays (60.3 min).
    *This means they might be more engaged in recreational or social rides, making weekends a great time to target them with membership promotions.
    

##Suggested Marketing Strategies to Convert Casual Riders to Members:
1. Thursday & Weekend Promotions

    - Offer discounts on annual memberships if they sign up after a Thursday ride.
    - Provide a "Weekend Membership Trial" where casual riders can get a limited-time free trial.

2. Highlight Cost Savings

    - Show casual riders how members pay less per ride compared to their long ride durations.
    Example: "If you ride 60+ minutes every Saturday, a membership saves you X amount per month!"

3. Introduce Referral Incentives

    - Reward casual riders if they refer a friend and both become members.

4. Targeted In-App & Email Campaigns

    -Send push notifications on Wednesdays & Thursdays, reminding them about membership benefits before their usual long Thursday rides.
